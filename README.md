## Project Overview
Youvatrade is a robust investment platform where customers can invest and get returns on their investment. It was built using Laravel.

This project was inspired from a client's idea I was to work on at the time. It exposed to me to different problems that would be considered in real life project including, KYC, tickets, manual payment resolution depending on location use-case, testing and admin functions.

I enjoyed the project all together.
